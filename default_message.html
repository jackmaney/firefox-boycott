	<p>Dear Firefox User,</p>

	<p>You are seeing this message instead of whatever page you're expecting to see because of a recent decision made by the Mozilla corporation. On March 24, 2014, Brendan Eich was promoted to the CEO of Mozilla. In 2008, Eich made a $1,000 donation in support of California's Proposition 8. As you probably know, Prop 8 was a (thankfully failed) attempt at destroying marriage equality in California. </p>

	<p>In 2012, when it was discovered that he made this donation, Eich wrote <a href="https://brendaneich.com/2012/04/community-and-diversity/">a non-apologetic apology</a> and <a href="https://brendaneich.com/2014/03/inclusiveness-at-mozilla/">another one in 2013</a>, shortly after the firestorm of controversy erupted around his promotion to CEO. His actions clearly indicate that he does not value the civil rights of LGBT individuals.</p>

	<p>Sadly, this is not all. In the 90's and early 2000's, Eich has made several donations to Pat Buchanan, Ron Paul, and Tea Party representative Thomas McClintock (R-CA) (<a href="http://tim.dreamwidth.org/1845008.html">source</a>).</p>

	<p>Brendan Eich is standing on the wrong side of history, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/01/mozilla-ceo-brendan-eich-refuses-to-quit?CMP=twt_gu">is doubling down</a>. Since Eich is the CEO of Mozilla, it follows that Mozilla is standing on the wrong side of history.</p>
